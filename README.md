This project is a simple sine Synth using Tone Js library and a spectrogram. The piano notes can be played from yout computer keyboard. The notes assigned to the keyboard follow the same organization as in Music sofware like Ableton or Fl Studio: q->C, z->C#, s->D, e->D#, etc...

To start the spectrogram, you need to click on the page. 

The spectrogram I readaptated for the project comes from a tutorial made by a Jake Albaugh (you can find him on Youtube or CodePen).
